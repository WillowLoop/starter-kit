description: Expand a rough idea into a detailed prompt for plan mode
---

I have this rough idea: $ARGUMENTS

Transform this into a well-structured prompt that I can use with plan mode.

The expanded prompt should:
1. Clearly state the goal
2. List specific requirements I might not have thought of
3. Mention relevant environments (dev/prod) if applicable
4. Include success criteria
5. Note any constraints or considerations

Output ONLY the expanded prompt, ready to copy-paste into plan mode. No explanation needed.
