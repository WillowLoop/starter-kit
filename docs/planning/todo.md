# Extension Opportunities

Ideas and opportunities for extending this starter-kit.
Larger initiatives → epic in `docs/planning/roadmap/`.

Format: `- [ ] **Title** — Description`
Optional sub-bullets for scope. Done items get a date.

## Open

- [ ] **Extend skills** — Review `.claude/skills/` and add missing implementation skills
  - feature-scaffold (create new feature frontend/backend)
  - design-system patterns (component creation)
  - API client setup (frontend↔backend integration)
  - auth flow (authentication/authorization)
- [ ] **Fill roadmap** — Replace placeholder epics in `docs/planning/roadmap/overview.md` with concrete epics including planning and priority
- [ ] **Define planning workflow** — Decide how TODOs, issues and progress are tracked (todo.md vs GitHub Issues vs combination) and document the choice

## Done

- [x] **Frontend and backend conventions in CLAUDE.md** — Conventions documented in `frontend/CLAUDE.md` and `backend/CLAUDE.md` (2026-02-14)
